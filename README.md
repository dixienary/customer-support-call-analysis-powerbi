# Power BI Dashboard – Customer Support Call Analysis

# Project Description

This Power BI dashboard analyzes customer support call data to evaluate call volume, agent performance, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
The goal is to help stakeholders identify performance gaps, optimize staffing, and improve customer experience.


# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
## Total Calls

- Represents the total number of customer support calls received.
- Used to measure overall demand on the support team.

## Average Handling Time (AHT)

- Measures the average duration (in minutes) agents spend handling customer calls.
- A critical operational efficiency metric.
- Lower AHT indicates faster issue resolution, while higher AHT may suggest complex issues or inefficiencies.

### Business Insight:
- High AHT combined with low customer ratings may indicate process or training issues.

## Average Customer Rating

- Represents the average satisfaction score given by customers after a call.
- Used to evaluate service quality and customer experience.
- Ratings range from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied).

### Business Insight:
- Agent performance and issue resolution quality directly impact customer ratings.

## Completed Calls Rate
- Percentage of calls successfully handled by agents.
- Indicates service capacity and availability.

### Formula Concept:
- Completed Calls ÷ Total Calls

## Missed Calls Rate
- Percentage of calls not answered or dropped.
- Highlights staffing gaps, peak-hour overloads, or scheduling issues.

### Formula Concept:
- Missed Calls ÷ Total Calls

### Business Insight:
A high missed call rate negatively impacts customer satisfaction and retention.

## Agent Performance Analysis
- Compares agents based on performance metrics such as:
  - Customer ratings
  - Call handling efficiency
-Identifies top-performing agents and opportunities for coaching.

## Call Volume & Complaint Analysis

- Helps understand most frequent customer problems and prioritize process improvements.

## Customer Satisfaction Analysis

- Enables tracking of service quality trends over time.
- Identifies areas impacting low satisfaction scores.

# Key Insights from the Dashboard
- Nearly half of calls are missed, indicating potential staffing or scheduling challenges.
- Technical Support and Billing Issues are the most common complaint types.
- Higher-performing agents consistently receive better customer ratings.
- Customer satisfaction can be improved by reducing missed calls and optimizing AHT.
