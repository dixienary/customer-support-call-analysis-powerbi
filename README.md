# Power BI Dashboard – Customer Support Call Analysis

# Project Description

This Power BI dashboard analyzes customer support call data to evaluate call volume, agent performance, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
The goal is to help stakeholders identify performance gaps, optimize staffing, and improve customer experience.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
# Total Calls

- Represents the total number of customer support calls received.
- Used to measure overall demand on the support team.

# Average Handling Time (AHT)

- Measures the average duration (in minutes) agents spend handling customer calls.
- A critical operational efficiency metric.
- Lower AHT indicates faster issue resolution, while higher AHT may suggest complex issues or inefficiencies.

## Business Insight:
- High AHT combined with low customer ratings may indicate process or training issues.
